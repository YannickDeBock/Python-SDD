#    SDD  Semidiscrete Decomposition.
#
#   [D, X, Y, _, _, _] = SDD(A) produces discrete matrices X and Y and a vector D
#   such that X * diag(D) * Y.T is the 100-term SDD that approximates A.
#
#   [D, X, Y, ITS, _, _] = SDD(...) also returns the number of inner iterations
#   for each outer iteration.  
#
#   [D, X, Y, ITS, RHO, _] = SDD(...) also returns a vector RHO containing the
#   norm-squared of the residual after each outer iteration.
#
#   [D, X, Y, ITS, RHO, IITS] = SDD(...) also returns a vector IITS
#   containing the number of extra matrix-vector multiplies used in the
#   initialization of each inner iteration when using C=1 (see below). 
#
#   [...] = SDD(A, K) produces a K-term SDD. The default is 100.
#
#   [...] = SDD(A, K, TOL) stops the inner iterations after the
#   improvement is less than TOL. The default is 0.01.
#
#   [...] = SDD(A, K, TOL, L) specifies that the maximum number of inner
#   iterations is L. The default is 100.
#
#   [...] = SDD(A, K, TOL, L, R) produces an SDD approximation that
#   either has K terms or such that the frobenius norm of (A - X * diag(D) * Y.') < R. Where ' means transpose and diag constructs a diagonal matrix
#   The default is zero.
#
#   [...] = SDD(A, K, TOL, L, R, C) sets the choice for initializing y in
#   the inner iterations as follows: 
#
#      C = 1       Threshold
#      C = 2       Cycling
#      C = 3,      All elements of y are set to 1.
#      C = 4,      Every 100th element of y is set to 1 starting with 1.
#
#   Default is C = 1.
